# SUNI Tokenomics

- **SUNI**, The UniSynth protocol token is live!
- **SUNI** contract address: [0x4cEe060Fe588D635A79dc1B879194d2dBAb95e72](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4cee060fe588d635a79dc1b879194d2dbab95e72) on the Arbitrum One Chain.
- Gensis supply of **SUNI** tokens is 32000, with 18 decimals.
- 100% of the **SUNI** genesis supply is allocated to a UniSwap SUNI-USDc pool.
- The UniSwap SUNI-USDc pool is located on the Arbitrum One Chain.    
- The UniSwap SUNI-USDc pool has bands of allocations, each band is 2x more expensive then the last (see table below).
- The governence body may remove USDc (liquidity) from this pool to fund development & other costs, it shall only remove the funds of a band 2 below the current traded band.      
- In the future the UniSynth protocol shall use exchange fees to purchase **SUNI** from this pool and burn it.  
- In the future **SUNI** holders may vote on the the management & govenance of **SUNI** and the UniSynth protocol.
- The UniSynth team have no relationship whatsoever with the UniSwap team/protocol. However we do think that UniSwap is awesome.

Note: The calculated band may slightly differ from the actual band in the uniswap pool. This is due to rounding in the UniSwap pools protocol.
